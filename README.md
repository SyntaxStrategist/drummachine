# Drum Machine

A responsive, interactive drum machine built with React that allows users to play various sounds through button clicks. This project was created as part of the freeCodeCamp Front End Libraries curriculum.

## Project Overview

This drum machine simulates a drum pad interface, where each button triggers a unique sound. The app is designed to be accessible on both desktop and mobile devices and offers features like volume control and a power toggle.

### Live Demo

## Features

- **Drum Pads**: Each button plays a unique drum sound when clicked.
- **Keyboard Support**: Users can also play sounds using corresponding keyboard keys.
- **Volume Control**: Adjust playback volume using a slider.
